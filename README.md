# Thermal-Comfort-Modeling: What is this project?

Thermal comfort is an important component of the built environment and affects the health and well-being of occupants. Personal comfort models (PCMs) are a novel paradigm in thermal comfort 
modeling and they use sensor data with machine learning algorithms. This project explores the use of deep learning for developing PCMs of 14 occupants using their raw physiological signals. 
We argue that deep learning approaches can better learn the temporal features of the time series data. Results show that deep learning can help in improving the overall performance of PCMs.
